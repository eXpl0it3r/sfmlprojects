# SFML Projects

While the SFML forum provides a section for [projects](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?board=10.0),
it happens too often that nice projects get lost in the depth of that sub-forum or
that the archive with the game gets deleted.
With the [SFML Projects](http://www.sfmlprojects.org/) website we want to provide a platform to host,
share and archive projects that were made with or for [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Contribute

You can do this by utilizing GitHub's ways of forking and creating pull requests or by poking me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sfmlprojects) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/SVs9GvhzCE).

I'll also hand out commit rights to people that seem eager to help an can follow these few rules:

- For every non-trivial change a pull request needs to be created, so I or others can review the changes.

## Local Development

### Download

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/sfmlprojects.git
...
git lfs fetch
git lfs checkout
```

### Configure

- Make sure the directories `content/` and `media/` are writeable
- Make sure the directories `assets/` and `content/` are readable
- Adapt the `site/config/config.php.example` content to your needs and remove the `.example` extension

That's basically it. From here on you can now start with the project files itself.
