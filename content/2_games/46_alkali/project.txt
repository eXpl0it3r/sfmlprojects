Description: Alkali is a precision platformer inspired by the chemical reactions of alkali metals. Use your physical properties to propel yourself across a variety of dangerous levels, coupling traditional platforming mechanics with the mass-based mechanics of the alkalic main character. Collect chunks of metal to grow yourself, leap into the water for an explosive jump, or barely graze past a whirring saw with just a sliver of body remaining.
