Description:

Squatbot brings tight, momentum-based platforming to mobile phones, with a control scheme designed specifically for touch screens. By tying the player's acceleration to their jump, Squatbot only requires two inputs - A tap on the left side of the screen to hop left, or a tap on the right side of the screen to hop right. 

These minimalist controls open the door to challenging, kinetic level design, with Squatbot hopping, skipping, and jumping through exciting challenges.
