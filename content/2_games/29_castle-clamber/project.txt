Description: Castle Clamber is an arcade inspired action platformer for one or two players, either locally or over a network. It tells the time-old story of a devoted underdog, blinded by a well-meaning sense of duty and a rose tinted visor. Trap enemies in your bubbles, defeat them with explosions or crush them with crates! Reclaim the food they stole and carry it to the waiting Princess Niamh to collect your prize and earn a place in the world online rankings.
