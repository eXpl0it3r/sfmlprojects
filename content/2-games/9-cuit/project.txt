Description: 

In CUIT, it is only you and your mind. A challenging and relaxing puzzle experience, ready to test you from top to bottom.
You are given a circuit. Interact with the buttons to navigate a current from the battery to a special target - Just make sure to avoid all the explosives, or you will have to start all over again. Sounds easy? Try it. And guess again.
