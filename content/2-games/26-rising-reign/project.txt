Description: 

Rising Reign is a high fantasy role-playing game with rogue-like elements. Most content is procedurally generated during world construction. Instead of having a linear, set-in-stone narrative, the world of Rising Reign will come alive through the interactions that take place between all of the NPCs. Like many other games that use procedural generation, Rising Reign will have to build its world before gameplay begins.

During world construction, centuries of history will be simulated. The story builds itself out of the compounding consequences that arise from NPCs simply going about their daily business and pursuing their life goals throughout the course of history. If the player discovers a plot to extort a village for gold, it will have happened because the conspirators have determined that the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks involved.

This philosophy of emergent complexity is applied extensively throughout the design of Rising Reign, not only with regard to the story. Merchant prices will fluctuate with the in-game economy, while dialogue will unfold in an organic style with conversation participants entering or exiting at will. Even certain aspects of magic will be governed by mysterious laws which the NPCs themselves will be speculative of.
