Description:

Thor is an open-source and cross-platform library written in the programming language C++. It is an extension to SFML, a multimedia library with functionality for 2D graphics, audio, network, user input and more. While SFML provides rather basic, generic features to allow a wide range of applications, the Thor library comes with high-level features that base on this framework and that are supposed to help in daily C++ routine, especially with respect to graphics and game programming.

To use Thor, you need a compiler compliant to C++11, for example Visual Studio 2010 or g++ 4.6.
