Description: FM Composer is a free and open-source music software, providing a tracker-style sequencer and a completely custom FM sound engine. FM means Frequency Modulation, it's the sound generation technique FM Composer uses. Waves are modulating each other to create new sounds. It was heavily used in the 80-90's with the Yamaha DX7, theSega Genesis and many other pieces of hardware. It saw a new popularity increase nowadays with electronic music. It may be a useful tool for any composer or musician who likes experimenting with sound.
